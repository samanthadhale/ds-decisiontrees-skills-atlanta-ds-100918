    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "Decision trees are tree structured (i.e. having a hierarchy), supervised learning algorithm that are mostly used in classification problems. It works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. In this technique, we split the data into two or more homogeneous sets based on most significant differentiator in input variables. A decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making so it remains highly explainable. DTs are highly popular tools in data mining, statistics for deriving a strategy to reach a particular goal. In this lesson, we shall focus on predictive abilities of a decision tree in the context of Machine Learning. \n",
